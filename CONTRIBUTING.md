# How to contribute

## Contribute with PRs

First of all, thanks for contributing! To contribute code, open a pull request with your changes.

I'd like to ask you not to format existing code, like adding semicolons or changing single quotes to double quotes everywhere. When contributing code, focus on your changes and nothing else.

## Developing locally

Install dependencies:

```
pnpm install
```

Run tests:

```
pnpm test
```

Run dev playground:

```
pnpm dev
```
